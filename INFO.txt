==================

- Make a TCP server in NodeJS (any version)
    127.0.0.1 | Port 1000
    
  - Make a TCP client in C++ that connects to the TCP server of NodeJS, the information of the server (127.0.0.1:10000) must be passed as an argument to the program.
  
    the C++ program must send an object (serialized as JSON) as soon as it starts that contain:
      - Current filepath of the program
      - Current username
      - Is he admin (admin true/false)
    (You can decide on the JSON structure)

    Username should not be passed through an argument.
    
    If the nodeJS server is offline, it must retry every 30 seconds until it's online.
    If the nodeJS server is online, it must reply with a confirmation of any sort and then stop the program.
      
  - If the NodeJS server receives something that isn't a valid JSON, it must return 'error' to the TCP client





Return a ZIP file within 2 hours from receiving this.
